function [MultiFocusDistanceIndexMatrix = MultiFocusDelayCalculator(LateralDistanceMatrix, MultiFocusPositionFractions, NumbSamples, dx);
%DelayCalculator Calculates the Delays associated with each element
%   MultiFocusPositions is a vector with % of where to focus on receive
%   that is 5 elements long (e.g. [0.18 0.36 0.54 0.72 0.90] would focus at
%   18%, 36%, ..., 90% of samples in depth with first focus covering depth
%   of 0-27%, 27-45%, 45-63%, etc

% old code for single focus
% [BeamLocationsMatrix,ElementLocationsMatrix] = meshgrid(BeamLocations,ElementLocations);
% LateralDistanceMatrix = ElementLocationsMatrix - BeamLocationsMatrix;

%% Convert Focus Positions to Distances in CM
Focus

%% Loop through focus positions to find delays
DistanceMatrix = sqrt(LateralDistanceMatrix.^2+Focus.^2);
DistanceDifferenceMatrix = DistanceMatrix - Focus;
DistanceIndexMatrix = round(DistanceDifferenceMatrix./dx); % gives delay index for how many samples away
